# Stock-Risk-Management

This project aims to do risk management by integrating advanced quantitative research algorithms to make risk assessments and analyses of stocks. Built using Google Colab notebooks, the dashboard fetches real-time financial data via APIs and visualizes various risk metrics for a portfolio. Additionally, the backend components, including the quantitative algorithms, are containerized using Docker to ensure scalability and reproducibility.

# Objective
The primary goal is to leverage quantitative research methodologies to:

1.  Assess the risk associated with individual stocks or a portfolio.
2.  Provide insights into market conditions and potential threats or opportunities.
3.  Offer actionable recommendations based on the quantitative analysis.
